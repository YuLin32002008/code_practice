Create a timebased key-value store class TimeMap, that supports two operations.

1. set(string key, string value, int timestamp)

Stores the key and value, along with the given timestamp.  
2. get(string key, int timestamp)  

Returns a value such that set(key, value, timestamp_prev) was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp.  
If there are multiple such values, it returns the one with the largest timestamp_prev.  
If there are no values, it returns the empty string ("").  


## Solution1: Map and binarysearch
```java

```
存储键值对用map，在有序列表中快速查找小于一个time的time_x，使用二分。  
此题中用到的： Pair,  Collections.binarySearch
