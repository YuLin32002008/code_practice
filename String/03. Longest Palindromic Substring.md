Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

## Example 1:
Input: "babad"  
Output: "bab"  
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.  

## Example 2:
Input: "cbbd"  
Output: "bb"  

## Solution:
In fact, we could solve it in O(n^2) time using only constant space.  

We observe that a palindrome mirrors around its center. Therefore, a palindrome can be expanded from its center, and there are only 2n−1 such centers.  

You might be asking why there are 2n−1 but not n centers? The reason is the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters. Such palindromes have even number of letters (such as "abba") and its center are between the two 'b's.  

```java
public static String longestPalindrome(String s) {
    	if(s == null || s.length() == 0){
    		return "";
    	}
    	
    	int left = 0;
    	int right = 0;
    	int len = 0;
    	char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
    	
    	for(int i = 0; i<ch.length-1; i++){
    		int len1 = centerAround(s,i,i);
    		int len2 = centerAround(s,i,i+1);
    		len = Math.max(len1, len2);
    		if(len >= right - left + 1){
    			left = i - (len-1)/2;
    			right = i + len/2;
    		}
    	}
    	
    	return s.substring(left,right+1);

        
    }
    
    public static int centerAround(String s, int left, int right){
    	int L = left;
    	int R = right;
    	while(L>=0 && R<=s.length()-1 && s.charAt(L) == s.charAt(R)){
    		L--;
    		R++;
    	}
    	return R-L-1;
    }
```
从string选择一个中心点，然后向两边延展。 这样的中心点有2n-1个   
Time complexity : O(n^2). Since expanding a palindrome around its center could take O(n) time, the overall complexity is O(n^2)

Space complexity : O(1).
