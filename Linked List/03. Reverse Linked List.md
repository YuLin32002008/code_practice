Reverse a singly linked list.

## Example:
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL

Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

## solution1, iterate
```java
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null ;
        ListNode curr = head;
        
        while(head != null){
        	curr = new ListNode(head.val);
        	curr.next = prev;
        	prev = curr;
        	head = head.next;
        	
        }
        return curr;
    }
```
单向链表，没有prev。 就自己initialize一个prev去当中转站。


## solution2, recursive
```java
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null || head.next == null){
        	return head;
        }
        ListNode p = reverseList(head.next);
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        return p;
    }
```
The recursive version is slightly trickier and the key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how do I reverse the front part? Let's assume the list is: n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 → … → nm → Ø

Assume from node nk+1 to nm had been reversed and you are at node nk.

n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 ← … ← nm

We want nk+1’s next node to point to nk.

So,

nk.next.next = nk;

Be very careful that n1's next must point to Ø. If you forget about this, your linked list has a cycle in it. This bug could be caught if you test your code with a linked list of size 2.
