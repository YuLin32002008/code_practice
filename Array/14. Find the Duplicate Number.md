Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

## Example 1:

Input: [1,3,4,2,2]

Output: 2
## Example 2:

Input: [3,1,3,4,2]

Output: 3

## Note:

You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).

You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.

Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).

There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## 1. Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection)ï¼š If we interpret nums such that for each pair of index i and value v_i, the "next" value v_j is at index v_i, we can reduce this problem to cycle detection. (P287)

```java
    public static int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
	        int tortois = nums[0];
	        int hare = nums[0];
	        do{
	        	tortois = nums[tortois];
	        	hare = nums[nums[hare]];
	        }while(tortois != hare);
	        
	        
	        //find entrance
	        int ptr1 = nums[0];
	        int ptr2 = tortois;
	        while(ptr1 != ptr2){
	        	ptr1 = nums[ptr1];
	        	ptr2 = nums[tortois];
	        }
	        return ptr1;
	    }
```
Time: O(n)  Space: O(1)
