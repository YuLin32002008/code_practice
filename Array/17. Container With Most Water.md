Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
## Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49


## Solution: Two Pointers
```java
public class maxArea {
    public static int maxArea(int[] height) {
    	int length = height.length;
    	if(length == 0){
    		return 0;
    	}
    	
    	int result = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = length-1;
        
        
        while(left < right){
        	int leftItem = height[left];
            int rightItem = height[right];
        	result = Math.max(result, Math.min(leftItem, rightItem)*(right - left));
        	if(leftItem<rightItem){
        		left++;
        	}else{
        		right--;
        	}
        }
        return result;
    }
```

Time: O(n)   Space: O(1)
